2. Name of Application

B.E.A. App (Break-Even Analysis application)

 

I'll imagine it to be hosted on "www.halogen.sg/entrepreneurship/beaapp", there's a BeApp, by the way

 

3. App/ Programme Description

In building a business, entrepreneurs need to ensure financial viability of their business model. What entrepreneurs earn from the sale of services and goods needs to cover the cost of their operations for their business to be profitable. This Break-Even Analysis Application is designed to give students a platform to simulate different cost and profit scenarios, to help them develop a better understanding of how their expenditure and revenue play a part in the financial performance of their business concepts. 

 

This Break-Even Analysis Application (BEA App) is built in collaboration with our corporate partners from UBS Singapore, and is a pro bono project kindly powered by volunteer efforts.
