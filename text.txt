Tips for Making Effective PowerPoint Presentations

·         Use the slide master feature to create a consistent and simple design template. It is fine to vary the content presentation (i.e., bulleted list, 2-column text, text & image), but be consistent with other elements such as font, colors, and background.

·         Simplify and limit the number of words on each screen. Use key phrases and include only essential information.

·         Limit punctuation and avoid putting words in all capital letters. Empty space on the slide will enhance readability.

·         Use contrasting colors for text and background. Light text on a dark background is best. Patterned backgrounds can reduce readability of text.

·         Avoid the use of flashy transitions such as text fly-ins. These features may seem impressive at first, but are distracting and get old quickly.

·         Overuse of special effects such as animation and sounds may make your presentation “cutesy”.

·         Use good quality images that reinforce and complement your message. Ensure that your image maintains its impact and resolution when projected on a larger screen.

·         Practice with someone who has never seen your presentation. Ask them for honest feedback about colors, content, and any effects or graphical images you’ve included.

·         Do not read from your slides. The content of your slides is for the audience, not for the presenter.

·         Do not speak to your slides. Many presenters face the direction of their presentation rather than their audience.

·         Do not apologize for anything in your presentation. If you believe something will be hard to read or understand, don’t use it.
